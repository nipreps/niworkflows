Utilities for the creation of nipype workflows.

Because these functions are meant to be inlined in nipype's ``connect`` invocations,
all the imports MUST be done in each function's context.

    Select the first file from a list of filenames.

    Used to grab the first echo's file when processing
    multi-echo data through workflows that only accept
    a single file.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> pop_file('some/file.nii.gz')
    'some/file.nii.gz'
    >>> pop_file(['some/file1.nii.gz', 'some/file2.nii.gz'])

    Convert to a list (inspired by bids.utils.listify).
